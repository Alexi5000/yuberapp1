# `client/src/components/ui/`

UI primitives and design-system components.

## What lives here

- Buttons, inputs, modals, menus, overlays, form primitives.
- Radix UI-based components and utility wrappers.

## Conventions

- Keep primitives small and reusable.
- Prefer composition over one-off variants.
