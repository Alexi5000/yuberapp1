# `server/_core/opik/`

Observability + tracing utilities (Opik integration).

## Status

This folder is currently **not part of the main build** (it’s excluded in `tsconfig.json`) to keep the core app compiling under strict settings while these utilities evolve.

## What lives here

- Trace/span client types
- Middleware helpers
- Cost/latency tracking utilities
